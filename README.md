- 👋 Hi, I’m @HansenMan91  
- 👀 I’m interested in game and mobile development, but being educated in business management I also have strong passion for product/concept development.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning doing a full circle website. Learning to setup everything from the database an api to showing it on the frontend.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on either ongoing projects where I can assist in completing user-stories or if you need a fresh pair of eyes for a new project you are setting up.  
- 📫 If you would like to reach me, you can find me on linked in: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-h-hansen/ or by mail: thomas91hansen@gmail.com.  
  
I am always open for a talk about what you are working on or if you are looking for people to join your team. I am a strong team-player who values a good relationship with transparency.
